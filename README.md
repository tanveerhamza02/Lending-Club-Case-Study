## General Information
- General Information : By applying the techniques of EDA, develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.
- Background : Consumer finance company which specialises in lending loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision.If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company.If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
- Business Problem: Understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss
